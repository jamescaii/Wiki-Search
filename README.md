# Wiki-Search

This search engine project is built in Scala and uses computer science concepts and techinques such as regex, pagerank, and hashmaps. The user will simply input a query that they want to search from which we will return the top page pages relevant to that search. They will continue searching until they enter :quit. The code will first generate our titles, docs, and words files from our processor by parsing a file name, and performing page rank on corpus as well as generating a wordsToDocumentFrequencies hashmap. These files will be saved for our query. In our query, we will receive an input and then find the documents with the greatest relevance to that input by finding the total word to document score of each word in the input and using page rank, which will be saved in a hashmap. From this hashmap, the code will generate the 10 most relevant pages to the query.
